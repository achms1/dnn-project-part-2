Implementation of Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network over Fashion - MNIST dataset


1) Training of GAN to be done using .ipynb. Contains sections for training generator model and testing Generator.
2) Also, all the images for each class are collected and saved into classes directory. These are the test images used in AutoEncoder.
3) User can run AutoEncoder-Final-DCGGAN.ipynb to verify similarity(cosine similarity) to training images.
4) User can run AutoEncoder-Final-DCGAN _ED_CS.ipynb to verify similarity(cosine similarity and Euclidean distance similarity to training i
